### **Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis**

In this task, we will analyze the food delivery operations by examining all associated costs and the profitability per order. This includes reviewing direct expenses such as delivery fees, packaging, and commission fees, as well as indirect expenses like discounts and refunds. We will then juxtapose these costs against the revenue generated through order values and commission fees.
